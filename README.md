# pickleball
This is the pickleball controller.
It was originally misnamed, with pickleball a subdirectory under another name. This is to correct that stupid error. 

What is in here: 
liz5.py is the picklemaster controller, the original python script created by Abrao and modified by me, which attempts to make a reservation. 
website.php is the picklemaster website, which lives at https://salaks.net. 
reservercourt.ps1 isn't used, it was part of an experiment in launching liz5.py from a windows machine
shortcut to powershell.txt is even less useful, but also part of futzing around with windows
index.php is a symlink to website.php, for apache. 
Pickle.png is just a picture of a pickle
picklerelay is a bash script, which lives in /usr/local/bin and is currently in my adminscripts (in svn) instead of in here.
